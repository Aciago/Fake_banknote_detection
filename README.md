### :muscle: Learning goals:
- apply and interpret PCA (Principal component analysis)
- apply K-means clustering algorithm
- build and apply logistic regression
- build, train and apply Machine Learning algorithms

### :briefcase: Scenario:
We work for a govermental agency that specializes at counterfeiting. Our mission is to create a counterfeit detection algorithm.

### :package: Dataset:
Our [dataset](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.oc-static.com/prod/courses/files/parcours-data-analyst/notes.csv) contains geometric characteristics of banknotes. For each of them, we know:
- length of the banknote (in mm) ;
- height of the banknote (measured on the left side, in mm);
- height of the banknote (measured on the right side, in mm) ;
- margin between the top edge of the banknote and the banknote image (in mm);
- margin between the lower edge of the banknote and its image (in mm);
- diagonal of the banknote (in mm).
